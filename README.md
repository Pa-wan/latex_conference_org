This is a template to create the material necessary for a conference
organisation.
In particular, each folder contains the .tex and other files necessary to
produce

- a book of abstracts
- badges for each participant

Both the book of abstracts and the badges are generated from the database file
list.csv, containing all the data concerning the participants, as an example.
However, the needed data can be further processed with some simple script, for
which I recomment using python and pandas.

Note that additional scripts might be needed to handle special characters, and
indeed some work is necessary to refine the result.
Nonetheless, this is a good starting point to handle a tedious task with a nice
result.
